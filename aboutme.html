    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <p>I am currently working through my future goal of getting involved with a career path the utilizes history as it main component. I've had an enjoyment for this even in my younger years. I've read, watched, and visited many different sources of history that tells it own story to the viewer and I truly enjoy this. These experiences have greatly helped me come close to  achieving this goal by providing information and skill sets that will be very helpful for this in the future. I have been working on this goal of mine by deciding to take many high honor classes like AP and also reading books about specific events. These classes will not only prepare myself for the future but can also help me figure out where my interest in topics may be because of the wide variety of options available to me and can help me narrow down a specific area I might want to study further. I consider a strong work ethic to be the most important value to me because this skill set will provide me with the necessary steps needed to work towards my success. This value will help me stop procrastinating on assignments even if they are very simple. This will also provide a strong mindset that will help me avoid burn-out from my job. The short-term goals that I would like to achieve in the future is to not only just take many advance courses like AP, but to also pass these courses because of the credibility that they pass onto universities if someone were to get very good scores. I plan to take these courses and hope to do well in them because they can provide college credits that will be useful for me in the long run. I would like to be best known by others as someone who has a efficient work ethic and won't get behind on assignments. I would also like to be known as someone who is passionate for their craft and isn't just doing the job for money but someone who actually cares for what they do. I would also like to be viewed as someone who is responsible and won't let the smallest things get in my way.</p>
